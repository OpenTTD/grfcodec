TODO:
- Finish linter:
  - Varaction2s (variable ranges) (?)
  - Value validation in action 0s.
  - Multi-pass linting
  - TextID usage
- Split/combine action 0s and 4s.
- Split(?)/combine action As and 12s.
- Provide better interface for translation. (?)
- Command line arguments to install/uninstall context menu support.
- Beautifier options:
  - Convert action Cs to comments (?)
  - Eat all comments, not just messages (?)
- Config file (!)
- Readability enhancements:
  - Express some things in decimal or big-endian hex.
  - Express action 2, 7/9, D operators as C operators
    Potential format for both: \<identifier><data>
    <identifier> being a single character, eg B/W/D
    <data> being the associated data, eg 600, x80000000, >, &c.
