How to compile GRFCodec
-----------------------

Compiling GRFCodec is pretty straightforward. It can be done, with varying
quantities of automation, with Cygwin's gcc (using Makefile for a
cygwin-dependant binary, any Linux gcc (using Makefile, for a Linux
binary).

Compiling with make
===================

The Makefile will attempt to auto-detect:
- Whether you are building on Cygwin or Linux (ISCYGWIN)
- The location of your boost includes (BOOST_INCLUDE)

If it gets these wrong, modify Makefile.local appropriately, or set the above
mentioned controlling variables.
ISCYGWIN: 1 on cygwin and 0 on Linux.
BOOST_INCLUDE is the directory where your boost headers can be found.


Targets
-------

The following are the most intersting targets. Other targets exist, but are
less useful.

all       Compile grfcodec, grfdiff, grfid and grfmerge

grfcodec
grfdiff
grfid
grfmerge  Compile the program in question, using gcc.
          Append _r to any of these to also strip/upx the resultant
          binary.

release   Compile all programs, then strip and upx them (if enabled)

clean     Delete all compiled files
remake    Equivalent of "make clean all"
