How to compile NFORenum
-----------------------

Compiling NFORenum is pretty straightforward. It can be done, with varying
quantities of automation by basically any gcc.

Compiling with make
===================

The Makefile will attempt to auto-detect:
- Whether you are building on Cygwin or Linux (ISCYGWIN)
- The location of your boost includes (BOOST_INCLUDE)

If it gets these wrong, modify Makefile.local appropriately, or set the above
mentioned controlling variables.
ISCYGWIN: 1 on cygwin and 0 on Linux.
BOOST_INCLUDE is the directory where your boost headers can be found.


Targets
-------

The following are the most intersting targets. Other targets exist, but are
less useful.

all
renum		Compile NFORenum.

release		Compile NFORenum, then strip and upx it.

clean		Delete all compiled files
remake		Equivalent of "make clean all"
