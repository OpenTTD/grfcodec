How to compile the GRF development tools
-----------------------

Compiling the GRF development tools is pretty straightforward. It can be
done, with varying quantities of automation, with Cygwin's gcc (using
Makefile for a cygwin-dependant binary, any Linux gcc (using Makefile,
for a Linux binary).

GRFCodec and NFORenum require Boost 1.36 or higher. The make system does
not check the Boost version, so compiling with a lower version of Boost
will result in compile failures.

GRFCodec and NFORenum can optionally be compiled with PNG support.
This requires libpng and zlib to be available.


Compiling with make
===================

The Makefile will attempt to auto-detect:
- Whether you are building on Cygwin or Linux (ISCYGWIN)
- The location of your boost includes (BOOST_INCLUDE)

If it gets these wrong, modify Makefile.local appropriately, or set the above
mentioned controlling variables.
ISCYGWIN: 1 on cygwin and 0 on Linux.
BOOST_INCLUDE is the directory where your boost headers can be found.


Targets
-------

The following are the most intersting targets. Other targets exist, but are
less useful.

all       Compile grfcodec, grfid, grfstrip and nforenum

grfcodec
grfid
grfstrip
nforenum  Compile the program in question, using gcc.

release   Compile all programs, then strip and upx them (if enabled)

clean     Delete all compiled files
remake    Equivalent of "make clean all"
