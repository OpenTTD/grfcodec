How to compile GRFCodec
-----------------------

Compiling NFORenum is pretty straightforward. It can be done, with varying
quantities of automation, with MSVC 2003 or basically any gcc.

Compiling with make
===================

The Makefile will attempt to auto-detect:
- Whether you are building on Cygwin or Linux (ISCYGWIN)
- The location of your boost includes (BOOST_VERSION and/or BOOST_INCLUDE)

If it gets these wrong, modify Makefile appropriately, or set the above
mentioned controlling variables.
ISCYGWIN: 1 on cygwin and 0 on Linux.
BOOST_VERSION is the version number of your boost install, in the same format
    that boost uses: x_yy for x.yy.0 versions and x_yy_z for x.yy.z versions.
BOOST_INCLUDE is the directory where your boost headers can be found. If you
    set BOOST_INCLUDE, is is not useful to also set BOOST_VERSION.

You may also set the following varibles:
NOREV: Set to 0 by default, set to 1 to remove the "rXXX" from the version
    number
SVNVERSION: Set to svnversion . by default. If you're using TortoiseSVN,
    change Makefile.setup to set it to SubECRev.exe . instead.


Targets
-------

The following are the most intersting targets. Other targets exist, but are
less useful.

all
renum		Will compile NFORenum.

release		Will compile NFORenum, then strip and upx it.

clean		Delete all compiled files
remake		Equivalent of "make clean all"



Compiling with Visual Studio 2003
=================================

Visual Studio can build NFORenum, in any of 5 different configurations:
Debug
Debug-NoVer
Release
Release-NoRev
Release-NoVer

Debug, Release, and Release-NoRev configurations use cygwin's make (which
they expect to find in C:\cygwin\bin) to make version.h and ttdpal.h, prior
to building NFORenum with Visual Studio's build engine. NoRev builds without
a revision number in the version string.
In the NoVer configurations, you are responsible for creating and updating
version.h. Instructions on how to do this live right next to the
#include "version.h" directive.

All Release targets expect to find upx in your PATH.
