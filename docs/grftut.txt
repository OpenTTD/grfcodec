   by [1]Josef Drexler.

   This tutorial is a list of the steps you need to take to edit a GRF
   file, and if you like, send your modifications to others.

   Since all GRFCodec programs are command line utilities (no graphical
   interface available), you have to make yourself familiar with the DOS
   or Windows command prompt. However, that's beyond the scope of this
   tutorial.

   These are the basic steps to modifiy a GRF file:
    1. Decode the GRF file
    2. Edit the PCX file
    3. Encode the GRF file

1. Decode the GRF file

   After installing the GRFCodec programs into your TTD folder, simply
   run GRFCodec. At the command prompt, type
grfcodec -d trg1.grf

   This will decode trg1.grf, and put an editable PCX file in the SPRITES
   folder.

   Note that the image will be quite huge, and if you instead want to
   split it into smaller files, use
grfcodec -d trg1.grf -w 800 -h 600

1a. Choosing a palette

   Skip this step unless you find that the colours are wrong. In that
   case, you need an extra option on the GRFCodec command line: the -p
   option. It tells GRFCodec to choose a different palette.

   After the -p option, you specify a number indicating which palette you
   want. You have the following choice:

   Number Meaning
   1      DOS TTD
   2      Windows TTD
   3      DOS TTD, Candyland
   4      Windows TTD, Candyland
   5      TT Original
   6      TT Original, Mars landscape

   So, for example, use "-p 2" when you're decoding a file from the
   Windows version of TTD, like so:
grfcodec -d trg1r.grf -p 2

2. Edit the PCX file

   For this, you open your favourite graphics editor, like Paintshop Pro,
   Adobe Photoshop, or any other graphics editor that can deal with PCX
   files. (Just about all of them can.)

   You should then load trg1.pcx in the SPRITES folder. Or, if you used
   the second command above to split it into smaller files, open
   trg10000.pcx, which is the first part. The following parts simply have
   higher numbers.

   If at this point you find that the colours are wrong, you need to
   decode the GRF again, using a different colour palette. In that case
   please follow the instructions in step 1a).

   If however everything looks fine, you can then start changing the
   sprites. Note that it is fairly difficult to actually change their
   size, but changing the look is easy enough.

   Once you've changed all you need, save the PCX file again.

3. Encode the GRF file

   This step is the reverse of step 1), it takes the PCX file(s) and
   makes a GRF file out of them. At the command prompt enter
grfcodec -e trg1.grf

   This will take a bit longer than decoding, but shouldn't take too
   long. Once it's done, you can start TTD and see the fruits of your
   labour!
