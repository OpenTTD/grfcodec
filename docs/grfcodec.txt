GRFCODEC

     * Copy it into your TTD directory
     * to decode a GRF file:

     grfcodec -d <grf-file>
       This will put a pcx file in a subdirectory called "sprites". It
       will also make a .NFO file that is needed to reconstruct the GRF
       file.
     * to encode a GRF file:

     grfcodec -e <grf-file>
       It will look in the sprites directory for both the PCX and the NFO
       file and make a GRF file out of this.

  Options

   When decoding:

        -w <width>
                To set the width of the PCX file

        -h <height>
                To set the maximum height of a PCX file. With this
                option, each GRF will be split into several PCX files.

                Note that both width and height should be large enough to
                accomodate the largest sprite in your GRF file, or you
                will get strange results.

        -b <boxsize>
                GRFCodec organizes the sprites in boxes in the PCX file.
                Use this option to choose the minimum size of these
                boxes.

        -p <palfile>
                Choose a differenct colour palette for the PCX file, for
                example when decoding TT Original or TT+World Builder
                graphics. See -p ? for a list of possible values.

        -x
        -xx
                Disable part or all of the Info version 7 format, reverting
                to the Info version 6 format.

        -X
                Print the sprite numbers in the PCX (but NOT the NFO) in hex

          Examples:

     grfcodec -d trg1.grf
     grfcodec -d -w 800 -h 600 trg1.grf
     grfcodec -d -p 6 mars.grf

   When encoding:

        -u
                To disable redundancy compression. This speeds up the
                encoding process, but it also greatly increases the size
                of the resulting .GRF file, and may reduce performance in
                TTD because it can only cache fewer sprites.

        -c
                Enable sprite-shrinking optimizations. Note that these are
                not necessarily safe. In particular, sprites that will share
                their bounding box (as for some station sprites) must not
                have their upper-right hand corner moved, and the sprite
                defining the bounding box must not be shrunk smaller than any
                that will share with it.
                Sprites with bit 6 of their compression byte set will never
                be shrunk.

        -s      Silences the progress output indicating which real sprite
                currently is being worked on.

   When doing either:

        -M <mapping>
                Map the colour palette from one type to another, for example
                to convert DOS GRF files to the Windows version or vice
                versa. See -m ? for a list of possible values.
        -m <mapping>
                As above, but do not map the colors of sprites that appear to
                be character glyphs. Such sprites use only the first three
                entries in the palette, regardless of what colors they may
                actually represent.

          Examples:

     grfcodec -e trg1.grf
     grfcodec -u -e trg1.grf
     grfcodec -m 1 trg1.grf

  What you can edit

   You can change all the sprites in the PCX file. Note that the colour 0
   (black) is the transparent colour. Any changes to the white background
   around the sprites will be ignored.

   It is possible to change the size of a sprite, but it is non-trivial.
   You have to edit the .NFO file -- even though it says "do not edit".
   For every sprite there's a line in the following format:

     <pcx filename> <x> <y> <type> <y-size> <x-size> <x-ofs> <y-ofs>

   In case you change anything, there are two things you must must MUST
   make sure, which is that:
     * The sprites remain in the correct order
       Do not delete lines or rearrange them, in particular do not delete
       or modify the strange block with a "*" as filename. These are
       special data that aren't sprites but go in the GRF file
       nonetheless.

   The sizes are given in regular decimal notation. You need to change
   these. Of course, you also have to make room for them in the PCX file.
   Therefore, the best way to enlarge a sprite is to:
    1. Decode the GRF file
    2. Edit the NFO file, change the size
    3. Encode the GRF file, even though you haven't edited anything in
       the PCX file
    4. Decode it again
    5. Edit the PCX file
    6. Encode it again

   Steps 3 and 4 are there to ensure proper spacing in the PCX file.
