Changes in 0.9.7
- support including binary files using "  4 ** data/dingdong.wav" syntax
- by Oskar: support // and # comments within pseudo-sprites
- fixed incorrect error message while encoding if .nfo file could not be read
  (now it reports "Cannot read %s" instead of Creating sprites/: File exists")
- made code -Wall clean
- remove myalloc stuff

Changes in 0.9.6
- by pasky:
  * made it possible to compile grfcodec on Linux
  * made compatible with gcc 3.x
  * when decoding, text strings are written in plain text (disable with -t)
  * supports plain text in .nfo files
  * fixed bug when first encoding a grf file wouldn't rename .new to .grf

Changes in 0.9.5
- self-extracting executables now work on Win2K etc., which doesn't pass
  the full path to the C library
- GRFMerge will just skip .grf files it can't find
- making sprites larger doesn't work if they're at the right edge; complains
  that ofsx too large; instead just use background colour
- GRFDiff doesn't like grfdiff -l 1254 ... (single value in -l), complains
  that there were no differences and makes no output
- allow GRFMerge to read GRFDiff's .exe files, both for -l and other options

Changes in 0.9.4
- fixed yet another crash while compressing
- sprites no longer need correct numbers in the .NFO file; just use "-1" for
  each number and it will be assumed to be correct

Changes in 0.9.3
- fixed crash due to buffer overrun while compressing
- slightly improved compression efficiency and speed
- GRFCodec now handles spaces in file/directory names properly
- GRFCodec now supports comments in .NFO files (from //, ; or # to end of line)
- speed up PCX processing

Changes in 0.9.2
- fixed crash if pcx file not found
- fixed crash if nfo file has no version info header

Changes in 0.9.1
- bug fix by Marcin: wrong order of test in encode function

Changes in release April 20 2002
- -p now actually uses the parameter you give it

Changes in release Dec 03 2001
- made -p option a valid option
- improve compression speed even more using assembly optimizations
- compression is now on by default, disable with -c-
- fixed bug where encoding would fail if the grf file didn't exist already
- fixed bug where decoding would fail creating the sprites directory
- corrected some mistakes in grf.txt (checksum, and initial offsets for tiles)

Changes in release March 26 2001
- fix bug that didn't flush last row if it only contained a single sprite
- fix bug with no height given (would make PCX have height -1)
- show percentage done while decoding
- fix compression algorithm
- improve compression performance
- try without compression if data is inconsistent after decompressing our
  compressed data (this shouldn't happen anymore anyway, report it as a
  bug if it does)
- -p to choose palette

Changes before release March 26 2001
- I don't remember anymore
